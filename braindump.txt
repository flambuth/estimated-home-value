-Rehearse more, of course

-Create more plots, even if they are not used in the process

-Model more than just the baseline

-Make a Presentation as soon as the MVP is finished

-PLOT of geographic distribution of tax values

Zach's Notes
-----------------------------
-Correlation heatmap is a little too busy. Might as well be a table.

-INTRO and CONCLUSION could be the same slide: The Findings

-Label the graphs and axis

-Default plotting of the yhat vs yactual was too dense too see overlap
	-change Alpha level so the denser parts will look darker
