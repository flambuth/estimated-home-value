-Rehearse more, of course

-Create more plots, even if they are not used in the process
	-show them off so your methods have some reasoning shown

-Model more than just the baseline

-Make a Presentation as soon as the MVP is finished
	-I forgot most of my train of thought when I thought I was "done". 
	-Most of my insights felt nebulous when it came time to make the presentation slide, 2 days later

-PLOT of geographic distribution of tax values

Zach's Notes
-----------------------------
-Correlation heatmap is a little too busy. Might as well be a table.

-INTRO and CONCLUSION could be the same slide: The Findings

-Label the graphs and axis

-Default plotting of the y-hat vs y-actual was too dense too see overlap
	-change Alpha level so the denser parts will look darker

-When a number is used a lot (ex. r2, MSE), explain what it represents when that word is introduced

-Explain the displayed graphs. Talk them through.
	-Talk them through.
	-What do the sizes, shapes, colors and positons mean?
