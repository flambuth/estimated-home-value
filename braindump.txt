-Rehearse more, of course

-Create more plots, even if they are not used in the process
	-show them off so your methods have some reasoning shown

-Model more than just the baseline

-Make a Presentation as soon as the MVP is finished
	-I forgot most of my train of thought when I thought I was "done". 
	-Most of my insights felt nebulous when it came time to make the presentation slide, 2 days later

-PLOT of geographic distribution of tax values

-Make laundry list of what the stakeholders ask for.
	-there are some 'unecessary' stuff to my process that is missing but could easily have been implemented
	-namely the t-test for significance between a h0 and hA.

Zach's Notes
-----------------------------
-Correlation heatmap is a little too busy. Might as well be a table.

-INTRO and CONCLUSION could be the same slide: The Findings

-Label the graphs and axis

-Default plotting of the y-hat vs y-actual was too dense too see overlap
	-change Alpha level so the denser parts will look darker

-When a number is used a lot (ex. r2, MSE), explain what it represents when that word is introduced

-Explain the displayed graphs. Talk them through.
	-Talk them through.
	-What do the sizes, shapes, colors and positons mean?


Maggie's Notes
------------------------------
-Derived features that could cut out multi-collinearity
	-sqft - bath_sqft, to get sqft that is not bathrooms. They ought to be Not Correlated.

-When you PLOT, UNSCALE
	-so that it makes sense. the -1/1 is only for the nerds, not the demo


Ryan's Notes
------------------------------
-Avoid passive voice

-Get rid of pro-nouns

-Make confirmatory announcements. No uptone sounds.

-Explain the charts. 2X
	-nobody knows what chart types are supposed to say.
